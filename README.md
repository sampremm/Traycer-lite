# Traycer-lite (Backend Demo)

Traycer-lite is a simplified backend demonstration inspired by **Traycer AI**. It captures the core concept of Traycer: a **planning layer on top of coding tasks**. Instead of writing code directly, Traycer-lite generates a structured plan for a given task and can simulate or execute it.

This project is designed as a **CLI tool** written in **TypeScript** and **Node.js**, showcasing the planning-execution workflow in a modular and clean manner.

---

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Task Input:** Users provide a coding task via CLI.
- **Planning Layer:** Generates a detailed step-by-step plan for the task.
- **Execution or Simulation:** Steps can either be executed (creating files/test stubs) or simulated.
- **CLI-Friendly:** Built using `inquirer`, `chalk`, and `commander` for an intuitive interface.
- **Modular Architecture:** Code is separated into planner, executor, and CLI modules for maintainability.

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. **Task Input**: The user inputs a task, e.g., `Add a user authentication API`.
2. **Planning**: `planner.ts` generates a sequence of actionable steps:
    - Define interfaces and file structure
    - Implement minimal code stubs
    - Add basic tests
    - Run tests or simulate commands
3. **Execution / Simulation**: `executor.ts` handles each step:
    - Creates files or directories
    - Writes plan notes to `TRAYCER_PLAN.md`
    - Runs commands or simulates them
4. **Output Summary**: The CLI prints a success/failure summary for each step.

This demonstrates a **planning-first approach**, which is the core vision of Traycer AI.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd traycer-lite
npm install
````

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

**Start the CLI:**

```bash
npm run start
```

* You will be prompted to enter a task:

```
? Describe the coding task (e.g. 'Add a user login API'): Add a user authentication API
```

* The CLI will generate a plan and execute it:

```
Generated Plan:
  1. Define interfaces & files
  2. Implement core code
  3. Add tests
  4. Run tests & lint
```

* Execution summary example:

```
Plan results summary:
- plan-1: ok â€” Wrote plan note to TRAYCER_PLAN.md
- plan-2: ok â€” Created file: src/add-a-user-authentication-api.ts
- plan-3: ok â€” Created test file: tests/add-a-user-authentication-api.test.ts
- plan-4: ok â€” Command output: no tests configured - simulation
```

**Simulate Execution Only (No Files Created):**

```bash
npm run run:sim
```

## ðŸ§© Example Plan

For the task `Add a user authentication API`, the generated plan might look like:

1. **Define interfaces & files** â€“ Create basic file structure and interfaces.
2. **Implement core code** â€“ Minimal code stub for authentication API.
3. **Add tests** â€“ Simple test to verify implemented behavior.
4. **Run tests & lint** â€“ Execute commands or simulate them and report results.

## âš¡ Tech Stack

* **Node.js**
* **TypeScript**
* **CLI Libraries:** `inquirer`, `chalk`, `commander`
* **File Management:** `fs-extra`

## âœ… Why This Submission Works

* Demonstrates **planning layer concept** (task â†’ plan â†’ execution).
* Backend-focused and fully in TypeScript.
* Modular, readable, and maintainable code.
* User-friendly CLI interface with **simulation mode**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* This project is designed for **backend submission only**.
* React or a web UI is **optional**, not required for backend roles.
* Simulation mode allows reviewers to see plan generation without creating files.
